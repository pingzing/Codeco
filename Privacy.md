Note that while Codeco makes a best-effort attempt to encrypt and secure your information, you are ultimately 
responsible for your data's security, and Codeco makes no guarantees about the security of your information. If you are uncertain about Codeco's 
security, you should not use it for storing sensitive information. The encryption algorithms are freely visible in the project's repository 
at http://github.com/pingzing/codeco.

Your data is never shared while unencrypted, and is _only_ shared with Microsoft's cloud servers to allow syncing of your files between multiple
devices, as outlined [here, under the 'Roaming Data' subsection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/app-settings/store-and-retrieve-app-data).
If you choose not to use the Syncing feature, then your data is never shared, period.
